# 👋 Hi there, I'm Haoling Yang!

🚀 Robotics Enthusiast | 🤖 Machine Learning Explorer | 🎯 Problem Solver

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m currently pursuing my **Master of Science in Robotic Systems Engineering** at **RWTH Aachen University**, Germany. My journey started with a passion for **Information Engineering** during my Bachelor's at **Beijing Jiaotong University**, and it has since evolved into exploring the intersection of **machine learning** and **robotics**.

---

## 🌟 Highlights of What I Do:
- **🧠 AI Research**: From building **surrogate models** with GANs to applying **AutoML** in industrial optimization, I thrive on creating intelligent systems that make life (and robots) smarter.
- **🤖 Robotics**: Innovating UAV-based solutions and integrating AI for autonomous inspection.
- **📊 Optimization**: Approximating simulations with ANN for time-efficient decision-making in **remanufacturing**.

---

## 📌 Technical Arsenal:
- **Languages and Frameworks**: Python, C/C++, MATLAB, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Topics I love**: Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Wireless Communication, Control Theory

---

## 🏆 Fun Facts & Achievements:
- Honorable Mention: **Mathematical Contest in Modeling (2021)**  
- Built a UAV system to map forest litter—because nature needs robots too!  
- Often found tweaking neural networks or debugging Python scripts with a cup of coffee ☕.
